# SmartMeter-InformationOverload
# README

An experiment I set up for my Bachelor thesis. You can find out more about this work by looking at my [thesis] (https://github.com/cgrossbaier/SmartMeter-InformationOverload/blob/master/thesis_FINAL.pdf).

### A little technical background

I implemented linear programming algorithms to setup parameters for tool in Python. 

The online tool was built using Python’s web framework Django. The multi-step GUI was created using HTML, Javascript and JQuery.

The experiment was offered as a Human Intelligence Tasks (HIT) on Amazon Mechanical Turk and therefore had an interface that was connected to MTURK. 
Overall, I recorded more than 30,000 data points in one week from 400 participants.

Data analysis was done using R. I mainly used Linear Mixed Models to account for individual statistical noise. The data was visualised using ggplot2 in R.

I received the highest mark for the bachelor thesis (1.0 – Top mark in German grading system)
